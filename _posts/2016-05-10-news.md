**Marriage for Peace: Thousands of couples tie the not in an International wedding ceremony for World Peace and intercultural Harmony.**

**S****eoul/South Korea, 20.02.2016 (FFWPU)**

-- On February 20th, 2016, the international Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, an organization with UN DPI status since 1998, held one of their traditional Holy Marriage Blessing Ceremonies with the participation of around 2.500 couples in Gapyeong, South Korea and some 10000 more couples world wide via Satellite link. The ceremony was officiated by Dr. Hak Ja Han Moon, widow of the late Dr. Sun Myung Moon, founder of FFWPU and many other related organizations. FFWPU aims at pointing out the centrality of Marriage and Family for a peaceful and harmonious society and world.

Since 1992, representatives of the world's religions take part in the ceremony and since that time the event became an Interreligious and intercultural Ceremony that seeks also to emphasize Peace and Harmony between the different ethnicities, nationalities and faiths.
